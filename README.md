# pac-man

## Brief
A build of the game pac-man using pure html, css, and vanilla js.

## View
- Live: https://ruairiconway.github.io/pac-man/
- Code: https://github.com/ruairiconway/pac-man

## Highlights
- Game is rendered using an array that dictates the layout + starting positions
- Pac-Man can be controlled by keyboard arrows or buttons on screen
- Pac-Man can eat ghosts after crossing 'power pellets'
- Game ends when Pac-Man eats all the dots (win condition) or if ghost catches Pac-Man (lose condition)
- Buttons are keyboard accessible + allows the game to work on mobile
- Aria labelling included

## Future Edits
- Adding in a start button to trigger the game
- Smarter ghost behavior
- press and hold buttons for direction (insetad of repeatedly tapping)
